Author: Yazdani Kiyan <yazdani.kiyan@protonmail.com>

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                       *nvim-tree-introduction*

This file explorer requires `neovim >= 0.5.0`

==============================================================================
QUICK START                                        *nvim-tree-quickstart*

open the tree with :NvimTreeToggle
>
  nnoremap <C-n> :NvimTreeToggle<CR>
  lua require 'nvim-tree'.toggle()
<

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                           *nvim-tree-commands*

|:NvimTreeOpen| 	                                  *:NvimTreeOpen*

opens the tree

|:NvimTreeClose| 	                          *:NvimTreeClose*

closes the tree

|:NvimTreeToggle| 	                          *:NvimTreeToggle*

open or close the tree

|:NvimTreeFocus| 	                          *:NvimTreeFocus*

open the tree if it is closed, and then focus on the tree

|:NvimTreeRefresh|			          *:NvimTreeRefresh*

refresh the tree

|:NvimTreeFindFile|				  *:NvimTreeFindFile*

The command will change the cursor in the tree for the current bufname.

It will also open the leafs of the tree leading to the file in the buffer
(if you opened a file with something else than the NvimTree, like `fzf` or
`:split`)

|:NvimTreeClipboard|			          *:NvimTreeClipboard*

Print clipboard content for both cut and copy

|:NvimTreeResize|			          *:NvimTreeResize*

Resize the NvimTree window to the given size. Example: `:NvimTreeresize 50`
resizes the window to the width of 50.

==============================================================================
SETUP                                *nvim-tree-setup*

To configure the tree (and make it runnable), you should call the setup
function.

>
    require'nvim-tree'.setup {
      disable_netrw       = true,
      hijack_netrw        = true,
      open_on_setup       = false,
      ignore_ft_on_setup = {},
      auto_close          = false,
      tab_open            = false,
      hijack_cursor       = false,
      update_cwd          = false,
      update_focused_file = {
        enable      = false,
        update_cwd  = false,
        ignore_list = {}
      },
      system_open = {
        cmd  = nil,
        args = {}
      },
    }
<

As options are currently being migrated, configuration of global options in 
*nvim-tree-options* should be done BEFORE the setup call.

Here is a list of the options available in the setup call:
- |disable_netrw|: completely disable netrw
  type: `boolean`
  default: `true`

- |hijack_netrw|: hijack netrw windows (overriden if |disable_netrw| is `true`)
  type: `boolean`
  default: `true`

- |open_on_setup|: will automatically the tree when running setup if current
  buffer is a directory, is empty or is unnamed.
  type: `boolean`
  default: `false`

- |ignore_ft_on_setup|: list of filetypes that will make |open_on_setup| not
  open. You can use this option if you don't want the tree to open in some
  scenarios (eg using vim startify).
  type: `{string}`
  default: `{}`

- |auto_close|: force closing neovim when the tree is the last window in the view.
  type: `boolean`
  default: `false`

- |tab_open|: opens the tree automatically when switching tabpage or opening a new
  tabpage if the tree was previously open.
  type: `boolean`
  default: `false`

- |hijack_cursor|: keeps the cursor on the first letter of the filename when
  moving in the tree.
  type: `boolean`
  default: `false`

- |update_cwd|: changes the tree root directory on `DirChanged` and refreshes
  the tree.
  type: `boolean`
  default: `false`

- |update_focused_file|: update the focused file on `BufEnter`, un-collapses
  the folders recursively until it finds the file

  - |update_focused_file.enable|: enable this feature.
    type: `boolean`
    default: `false`

  - |update_focused_file.update_cwd|: update the root directory of the tree to the one 
    of the folder containing the file if the file is not under the current root 
    directory. Only relevant when |update_focused_file.enable| is `true`
    type: `boolean`
    default: `false`

  - |update_focused_file.ignore_list|: list of buffer names and filetypes that will not
    update the root dir of the tree if the file isn't found under the current root 
    directory. Only relevant when |update_focused_file.update_cwd| is `true` and 
    |update_focused_file.enable| is `true`.
    type: `{string}`
    default: `{}`

- |system_open|: configuration options for the system open command

  - |system_open.cmd|: the command to run, leaving nil should work but
    useful if you want to override the default command with another one.
    type: `string`
    default: `nil`

  - |system_open.args|: the command arguments as a list
    type: `{string}`
    default: `{}`

==============================================================================
OPTIONS				                  *nvim-tree-options*

|g:nvim_tree_width|				*g:nvim_tree_width*

width of the window, can be *width_in_columns* or *'width_in_percent%'*
>
    let g:nvim_tree_width = 30 " indicates width of 30 columns
    let g:nvim_tree_width = '30%' " indicates width of 30% of '&columns'

|g:nvim_tree_side|				*g:nvim_tree_side*

where the window will open (default to 'left')
- 'left' or 'right'

|g:nvim_tree_ignore|				*g:nvim_tree_ignore*

An array of strings that the tree won't load and display.
useful to hide large data/cache folders.
>
    example: let g:nvim_tree_ignore = [ '.git', 'node_modules' ]

|g:nvim_tree_gitignore|				*g:nvim_tree_gitignore*

Determines whether to include in g:nvim_tree_ignore
files ignored by git.

Must be:
    0: not ignored
    1: ignored files from `git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard --directory`

>
|g:nvim_tree_show_icons|			        *g:nvim_tree_show_icons*

Dictionary, if your terminal or font doesn't support certain unicode
character, the tree UI might be messed up. The following configuration
can disable icons per type:
>
    let g:nvim_tree_show_icons = {
	\ 'git': 1,
	\ 'folders': 1,
	\ 'files': 1,
  \ 'folder_arrows': 1,
	\}

Can be one of `1` and `0` for each key. By default the tree will try
to render the icons. The `files` key can only work if `nvim-web-devicons`
is installed and in your |runtimepath|
(https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons)
if folder is 1, you can also set `folder_arrows = 1` to show small arrows
next to the folder icons but this will not work when you set 
|g:nvim_tree_indent_markers| (because of UI conflict).

|g:nvim_tree_highlight_opened_files|			        *g:nvim_tree_highlight_opened_files*

Highlight icons and/or names for opened files and directories
Default is 0

Must be:
    0: No highlight
    1: Enable highligting for folders and file icons only.
    2: Enable highligting for folders and file names only.
    3: Enable highligting for folders and both file icons and names.

|g:nvim_tree_icons|                                *g:nvim_tree_icons*

You can set icons for:

- The git status.
- The default icon that shows when no icon is found for a file
  or if you are not using icons.
- Symlinks. If an icon is not provided, the `default` icon is used.

|g:nvim_tree_bindings|                             *g:nvim_tree_bindings*

You can define your own keymaps with this syntax:
>
  lua <<EOF
      vim.g.nvim_tree_bindings = {
        { key = {"<CR>", "o" }, cb = ":lua some_func()<cr>"}
        { key = "<Tab>", mode = "v", cb = ":lua some_func()<cr>"}
      }
  EOF
<
`key` can be either a string or a table of strings
`mode` is `n` by default if you don't specify it
`cb` is the command that will be called when the keymap is triggered

Default mappings:
>
  lua <<EOF

|Features|					*nvim-tree-features*

File icons with vim-devicons.

Uses other type of icons so a good font support is recommended.
If the tree renders weird glyphs, install the correct fonts.

Syntax highlighting uses g:terminal_color_ from colorschemes, fallbacks to
ugly colors otherwise.

Git integration tells when a file is:
- ✗  unstaged or folder is dirty
- ✓  staged
- ★  new file
- ✓ ✗ partially staged
- ✓ ★ new file staged
- ✓ ★ ✗ new file staged and has unstaged modifications
- ═  merging
- ➜  renamed

Mouse support defined in |KeyBindings|

HIGHLIGHT GROUPS				        *nvim-tree-highlight*

|nvim_tree_highlight|				        *nvim_tree_highlight*

All the following highlight groups can be configured by hand. It is not
advised to colorize the background of these groups.

Example (in your `init.vim`):
>
    highlight NvimTreeSymlink guifg=blue gui=bold,underline
<
You should have 'termguicolors' enabled, otherwise, colors will not be
applied.

EVENTS                                                 *nvim-tree-events*

|nvim_tree_events|                                     *nvim_tree_events*

nvim-tree will dispatch events whenever an action is made. These events can be
subscribed to through handler functions. This allows for even further
customization of nvim-tree.

A handler for an event is just a function which receives one argument -
the payload of the event. The payload is different for each event type. Refer
to |nvim_tree_registering_handlers| for more information.
<

|nvim_tree_registering_handlers|                *nvim_tree_registering_handlers*

Handlers are registered by calling the `on_*` functions available in the
`require('nvim-tree.events')` module. See |nvim-tree.events|.


For example, registering a handler for when a node is renamed is done like this: >

    local events = require('nvim-tree.events')

    events.on_node_renamed(function(data)
        print("Node renamed from " .. data.old_name .. " to " ..  data.new_name)
    end)
