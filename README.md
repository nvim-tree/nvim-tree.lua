# A File Explorer For Neovim Written In Lua

[![Linting and style checking](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua/actions/workflows/luacheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua/actions/workflows/luacheck.yml)

## Notice

This plugin requires [neovim >=0.5.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim).

If you have issues since the recent setup migration, check out [this guide](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua/issues/674)

## Install

Install with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
" requires
Plug 'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons' " for file icons
Plug 'kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua'
```

Install with [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use {
    'kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua',
    requires = {
      'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons', -- optional, for file icon
    },
    config = function() require'nvim-tree'.setup {} end
}
```

## Setup

Options are currently being migrated into the setup function, you need to run `require'nvim-tree'.setup()` in your personal configurations.
Setup should be run in a lua file or in a lua heredoc (`:help lua-heredoc`) if using in a vim file.
Note that options under the `g:` command should be set **BEFORE** running the setup function.

```lua
-- following options are the default
-- each of these are documented in `:help nvim-tree.OPTION_NAME`
require'nvim-tree'.setup {
  disable_netrw       = true,
  hijack_netrw        = true,
  open_on_setup       = false,
  ignore_ft_on_setup  = {},
  auto_close          = false,
  open_on_tab         = false,
  hijack_cursor       = false,
  update_cwd          = false,
  update_to_buf_dir   = {
    enable = true,
    auto_open = true,
  },
  diagnostics = {
    enable = false,
    icons = {
      hint = "",
      info = "",
      warning = "",
      error = "",
    }
  },
  update_focused_file = {
    enable      = false,
    update_cwd  = false,
    ignore_list = {}
  },
  system_open = {
    cmd  = nil,
    args = {}
  },
  filters = {
    dotfiles = false,
    custom = {}
  },
  git = {
    enable = true,
    ignore = true,
    timeout = 500,
  },
  view = {
    width = 30,
    height = 30,
    hide_root_folder = false,
    side = 'left',
    auto_resize = false,
    mappings = {
      custom_only = false,
      list = {}
    },
    number = false,
    relativenumber = false
  },
  trash = {
    cmd = "trash",
    require_confirm = true
  }
}
```

These additional options must be set **BEFORE** calling `require'nvim-tree'` or calling setup.
They are being migrated to the setup function bit by bit, check [this issue](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua/issues/674) if you encounter any problems related to configs not working after update.

## KeyBindings

### Default actions

- `<CR>` or `o` on `..` will cd in the above directory
- `<C-]>` will cd in the directory under the cursor
- `<BS>` will close current opened directory or parent
- type `a` to add a file. Adding a directory requires leaving a leading `/` at the end of the path.
  > you can add multiple directories by doing foo/bar/baz/f and it will add foo bar and baz directories and f as a file
- type `r` to rename a file
- type `<C-r>` to rename a file and omit the filename on input
- type `x` to add/remove file/directory to cut clipboard
- type `c` to add/remove file/directory to copy clipboard
- type `y` will copy name to system clipboard
- type `Y` will copy relative path to system clipboard
- type `gy` will copy absolute path to system clipboard
- type `p` to paste from clipboard. Cut clipboard has precedence over copy (will prompt for confirmation)
- type `d` to delete a file (will prompt for confirmation)
- type `D` to trash a file (configured in setup())
- type `]c` to go to next git item
- type `[c` to go to prev git item
- type `-` to navigate up to the parent directory of the current file/directory
- type `s` to open a file with default system application or a folder with default file manager (if you want to change the command used to do it see `:h nvim-tree.setup` under `system_open`)
- if the file is a directory, `<CR>` will open the directory otherwise it will open the file in the buffer near the tree
- if the file is a symlink, `<CR>` will follow the symlink (if the target is a file)
- `<C-v>` will open the file in a vertical split
- `<C-x>` will open the file in a horizontal split
- `<C-t>` will open the file in a new tab
- `<Tab>` will open the file as a preview (keeps the cursor in the tree)
- `I` will toggle visibility of hidden folders / files
- `H` will toggle visibility of dotfiles (files/folders starting with a `.`)
- `R` will refresh the tree
- Double left click acts like `<CR>`
- Double right click acts like `<C-]>`

### Settings

The `list` option in `view.mappings.list` is a table of
```lua
-- key can be either a string or a table of string (lhs)
-- cb is the callback that will be called
-- mode is normal by default
local list = {
  { key = {"<CR>", "o" }, cb = ":lua some_func()<cr>", mode = "n"}
}
```

These are the default bindings:
```lua
local tree_cb = require'nvim-tree.config'.nvim_tree_callback
-- default mappings
local list = {
  { key = {"<CR>", "o", "<2-LeftMouse>"}, cb = tree_cb("edit") },
  { key = {"<2-RightMouse>", "<C-]>"},    cb = tree_cb("cd") },
  { key = "<C-v>",                        cb = tree_cb("vsplit") },
  { key = "<C-x>",                        cb = tree_cb("split") },

  { key = "<",                            cb = tree_cb("prev_sibling") },

  { key = "<S-CR>",                       cb = tree_cb("close_node") },
  { key = "<Tab>",                        cb = tree_cb("preview") },
  { key = "K",                            cb = tree_cb("first_sibling") },

  { key = "I",                            cb = tree_cb("toggle_ignored") },
  { key = "H",                            cb = tree_cb("toggle_dotfiles") },
  { key = "R",                            cb = tree_cb("refresh") },
  { key = "a",                            cb = tree_cb("create") },
  { key = "d",                            cb = tree_cb("remove") },
  { key = "D",                            cb = tree_cb("trash") },
  { key = "r",                            cb = tree_cb("rename") },
  { key = "<C-r>",                        cb = tree_cb("full_rename") },
  { key = "x",                            cb = tree_cb("cut") },
  { key = "c",                            cb = tree_cb("copy") },
  { key = "p",                            cb = tree_cb("paste") },
  { key = "y",                            cb = tree_cb("copy_name") },
  { key = "Y",                            cb = tree_cb("copy_path") },
  { key = "gy",                           cb = tree_cb("copy_absolute_path") },
  { key = "[c",                           cb = tree_cb("prev_git_item") },
  { key = "]c",                           cb = tree_cb("next_git_item") },
  { key = "-",                            cb = tree_cb("dir_up") },
  { key = "s",                            cb = tree_cb("system_open") },
  { key = "q",                            cb = tree_cb("close") },
  { key = "g?",                           cb = tree_cb("toggle_help") },
  { key = 'm',                            cb = ":lua require'nvim-tree.marks'.toggle_mark()<cr>" },
  { key = 'M',                            cb = ":lua require'nvim-tree.marks'.disable_all()<cr>" },
}
```

You can toggle the help UI by pressing `g?`.

## Tips & reminders

1. you can add a directory by adding a `/` at the end of the paths, entering multiple directories `BASE/foo/bar/baz` will add directory foo, then bar and add a file baz to it.

## Features

- Open file in current buffer or in split with FzF like bindings (`<CR>`, `<C-v>`, `<C-x>`, `<C-t>`)
- File icons with nvim-web-devicons
- Syntax highlighting ([exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) like)
- Change directory with `.`
- Add / Rename / delete files
- Git integration (icons and file highlight)
- Lsp diagnostics integration (signs)
- Indent markers
- Marks (for bulk actions, see `:help nvim-tree.marks`)
- Mouse support
- It's fast
