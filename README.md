## KeyBindings

### Default actions

- move around like in any vim buffer
- `<CR>` or `o` on `..` will cd in the above directory
- `<C-]>` will cd in the directory under the cursor
- `<BS>` will close current opened directory or parent
- type `a` to add a file. Adding a directory requires leaving a leading `/` at the end of the path.
  > you can add multiple directories by doing foo/bar/baz/f and it will add foo bar and baz directories and f as a file
- type `r` to rename a file
- type `<C-r>` to rename a file and omit the filename on input
- type `x` to add/remove file/directory to cut clipboard
- type `c` to add/remove file/directory to copy clipboard
- type `y` will copy name to system clipboard
- type `Y` will copy relative path to system clipboard
- type `gy` will copy absolute path to system clipboard
- type `p` to paste from clipboard. Cut clipboard has precedence over copy (will prompt for confirmation)
- type `d` to delete a file (will prompt for confirmation)
- type `]c` to go to next git item
- type `[c` to go to prev git item
- type `-` to navigate up to the parent directory of the current file/directory
- type `s` to open a file with default system application or a folder with default file manager (if you want to change the command used to do it see `:h g:nvim_tree_system_open_command` and `:h g:nvim_tree_system_open_command_args`)
- if the file is a directory, `<CR>` will open the directory otherwise it will open the file in the buffer near the tree
- if the file is a symlink, `<CR>` will follow the symlink (if the target is a file)
- `<C-v>` will open the file in a vertical split
- `<C-x>` will open the file in a horizontal split
- `<C-t>` will open the file in a new tab
- `<Tab>` will open the file as a preview (keeps the cursor in the tree)
- `I` will toggle visibility of folders hidden via |g:nvim_tree_ignore|
- `H` will toggle visibility of dotfiles (files/folders starting with a `.`)
- `R` will refresh the tree
- Double left click acts like `<CR>`
- Double right click acts like `<C-]>`

### Setup

You can disable default mappings with

```vim
" let g:nvim_tree_disable_keybindings=1
```

But you won't be able to map any keys from the setup with nvim_tree_bindings. Use with caution.

You can use only your mappings with

```vim
let g:nvim_tree_disable_default_keybindings = 1
```

You can define your own keymaps with this syntax:

```vim
lua <<EOF
    vim.g.nvim_tree_bindings = {
      { key = {"<CR>", "o" }, cb = ":lua some_func()<cr>"}
      { key = "<Tab>", mode = "v", cb = ":lua some_func()<cr>"}
    }
EOF
```

Notes:

- `key` can be either a string or a table of strings
- `mode` is `n` by default if you don't specify it
- `cb` is the command that will be called when the keymap is triggered

If you don't use one of the options above, your keymaps will be added to the default keymaps.

```vim
lua <<EOF
    local tree_cb = require'nvim-tree.config'.nvim_tree_callback
    -- default mappings
    vim.g.nvim_tree_bindings = {
      { key = {"<CR>", "o", "<2-LeftMouse>"}, cb = tree_cb("edit") },
      { key = {"<2-RightMouse>", "<C-]>"},    cb = tree_cb("cd") },
      { key = "<C-v>",                        cb = tree_cb("vsplit") },
      { key = "<C-x>",                        cb = tree_cb("split") },
      { key = "<C-t>",                        cb = tree_cb("tabnew") },
      { key = "<",                            cb = tree_cb("prev_sibling") },

      { key = "<BS>",                         cb = tree_cb("close_node") },
      { key = "<S-CR>",                       cb = tree_cb("close_node") },
      { key = "<Tab>",                        cb = tree_cb("preview") },
      { key = "K",                            cb = tree_cb("first_sibling") },
      { key = "J",                            cb = tree_cb("last_sibling") },
      { key = "I",                            cb = tree_cb("toggle_ignored") },
      { key = "H",                            cb = tree_cb("toggle_dotfiles") },
      { key = "R",                            cb = tree_cb("refresh") },
      { key = "a",                            cb = tree_cb("create") },
      { key = "d",                            cb = tree_cb("remove") },

      { key = "x",                            cb = tree_cb("cut") },
      { key = "c",                            cb = tree_cb("copy") },
      { key = "p",                            cb = tree_cb("paste") },
      { key = "y",                            cb = tree_cb("copy_name") },
      { key = "Y",                            cb = tree_cb("copy_path") },
      { key = "gy",                           cb = tree_cb("copy_absolute_path") },
      { key = "[c",                           cb = tree_cb("prev_git_item") },
      { key = "]c",                           cb = tree_cb("next_git_item") },
      { key = "-",                            cb = tree_cb("dir_up") },
      { key = "s",                            cb = tree_cb("system_open") },
      { key = "q",                            cb = tree_cb("close") },
      { key = "g?",                           cb = tree_cb("toggle_help") },
    }
EOF
```

You can toggle the help UI by pressing `g?`.

## Note

This plugin is very fast because it uses the `libuv` `scandir` and `scandir_next` functions instead of spawning an `ls` process which can get slow on large files when combining with `stat` to get file informations.

## Features

- Open file in current buffer or in split with FzF like bindings (`<CR>`, `<C-v>`, `<C-x>`, `<C-t>`)
- File icons with nvim-web-devicons
- Syntax highlighting ([exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) like)
- Change directory with `.`
- Add / Rename / delete files
- Git integration (icons and file highlight)
- Lsp diagnostics integration (signs)
- Indent markers
- Mouse support
- It's fast

## Tips

- You can edit the size of the tree during runtime with `:lua require'nvim-tree.view'.View.width = 50`
